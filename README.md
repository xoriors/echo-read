EchoRead transforms any written content — articles, books, PDFs, newsletters, or webpages — into a clear, natural spoken experience.  
Upload a link, and within seconds, the app reads it aloud in a human voice.  
It’s built for everyone who wants to absorb knowledge hands-free — from visually impaired users to professionals on the move.
